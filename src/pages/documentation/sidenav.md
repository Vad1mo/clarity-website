##### The sidenav is a left-aligned navigational component. {.component-summary}

Clarity's sidenav is placed inside the <code class="clr-code">.main-container</code> class and appears after the <code class="clr-code">.content-area</code>.


###### .sidenav-content

This is a wrapper intended to contain one or more <code class="clr-code">.nav-group</code> groups.

###### .nav-group

A <code class="clr-code">.nav-group</code> consists of a checkbox and label followed by a <code class="clr-code">.nav-list</code>. The order of the markup is important to achieve the collpasible effect on the nav-groups.

###### .collapsible

A <code class="clr-code">.nav-group</code> inside a sidenav becomes collapsible by adding a <code class="clr-code">.collapsible</code> class.

###### .nav-list

A <code class="clr-code">.nav-list</code> is a list of navigation links. Each navigation link extends the <code class="clr-code">.nav-link</code> class. An active <code class="clr-code">.nav-link</code> is assigned the <code class="clr-code">.active</code> class.

### Usage {#guidelines}
The sidenav is a familiar navigation pattern for users.  The sidenav can fit as many navigation links as needed, scrolling when the content exceeds the viewport.  Use the sidenav:

- For links secondary to the links in the header or subnav
- For a navigation schema with a deep hierarchy
- When the header and subnav cannot accommodate the required links
{.list}

The sidenav works best in desktop applications.  

#### Grouping Links
If you group link names under a heading, don't make the heading a link.

#### Using Icons
Include icons when you want to provide a more appealing visual look than just text.
